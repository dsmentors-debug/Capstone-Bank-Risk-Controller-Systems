**Bank_Risk_Controller_System **

Bank-risk-controller-system-ML In the financial industry, assessing the risk of customer default is crucial for maintaining a healthy credit portfolio. Default occurs when a borrower fails to meet the legal obligations of a loan. Accurate prediction of default can help financial institutions mitigate risks, allocate resources efficiently, and develop strategies to manage potentially delinquent accounts. This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of customer default using historical data.

**Overview**:
The objective is to predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on various features related to their credit history, personal information, and financial status. The target variable for this prediction is “TARGET”, where a value of 1 indicates default and 0 indicates no default.
